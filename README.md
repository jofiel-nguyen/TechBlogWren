# MVC-From-Rice-Wren/14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog
## My Task

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. I spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but I also devote some of my time to reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

My task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. I'll be building this site completely from scratch and deploying it to Heroku. My app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
